# Problems from Learning from Data

I am working through the problems from the excellent text book on machine learning, _Learning From Data_, by Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa et al.

I am also learning julia.

Please don't copy these solutions for a class, I am putting them online for learning purposes only (and to share with a few friends of mine who are also working through the book).

You may need to install a few latex and julia packages to get them to work.
